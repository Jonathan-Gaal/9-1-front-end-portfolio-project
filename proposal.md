### User Stories

1. As a user, when I visit the website I see a way to navigate to multiple pages.

2. As a user, when I visit the website I see a list of quotes that are retrieved from an API.

3.  As a user, I can select a quote and it will appear on a different part of the page so that I can style it.

 4. As a user, I can update the presentation of a quote by changing the background color or font.

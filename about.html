            <h2><strong>Aquainting the Scientist Behind the Madness...</strong></h2>
            <p>Welcome to Jonathan Gaal's House of Wisdom, where the past meets the present. My favorite way to do things and live tends towards the proverbial "old-fashioned-way." But the modern age lays claim upon us all. The above sentiment is the inspiration for this project. The content of my pages you see before you, splayed across the browser is rooted in the past. And yet the lines of this figurative "digital poetry", is written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript -- truly the modern language of the web.

                    <p>I certainly could digress in this manner, in a hemorrhage of poetic recital in infinitum... naturally. But who amongst thou behind thy screens, in fabled "internet-land" would support such an exhibition. The answer to that tantalizing question comes from that memorable witty title of the late, great Peter Ustinov's hilariously fascinating autobiography. That answer is of course... only "DEAR ME!!!" For only dear me adores the sound of his own virtual voice as much as I do!</p>
                        
                    <h2><strong></strong>Purpose of this Project... </strong>("TLDR" peeps skip to last)</h2>

                    <p>
                        As a lover of traditional cultures, I have been enamored of a few in my time: Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Mongolian, Meso-American (In particular Incan)... just to mention a few. 
                        Lately however, I have a new love, what I term Afro-Asian. This simply means those regions in the Middle-East (Asia), North-Africa, and Central-Asia, where the culture has been Islamacized, or is some meld of Islam and the local flavor. A few examples range from Morocco in the west, Turkey, and Suadia Arabia in the middle, and Afghanistan or Uzbekistan in the East. A strong case could be made for the inclusion of Mongolia -- even though the predominant faith / cultural influence in those parts is Buddhist, due to fairly extensive cultural diffusion from Afro-Asia that came by way of the Turkic tribes that migrated out of Central-Asia , settled in other parts (Turkey being the most notable example), became Islamacized and influenced their homeland again in turn.

                        The European continent has been long fascinated by Afro-Asia, an obsession with acutely disastrous consequences, especially upon the objects of the obsession-- The Afro-Asian populations and their cultures. I need only refer you to any Google search on the infamous "Age of Colonialism". Arguably these toxic hegemonic relationships have morphed into national socio-economic relationships that are a manifestation of a phenomenon that has been termed <em>neo-Colonialism</em>. The short version is that former colonial powers mantained a bit of a stranglehold upon their former colonies (now independent nations) via economic ties that work to the former landlord's benefit, keeping the former tenant-in -their-own-home economically dependent. But that's a topic I wanted to lightly tough, but cannot fully address here, for only dear me would read it.

                        One of the most visible and often distateful manifestations of this obsession, is the genre of European art referred to as "Orientalism". Orientalist art is often demonized by modern Post-Colonial scholarship. In fact, the very concept of, and name "Oriental" is so loaded that scholars unburdened themselves of the baggage and depricated the term. Hencemy coining of the term Afro-Asian.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The subjects in Orientalist pieces are very often sexualized and fetishized in nature. Either brown Afro-Asian women are painted in sultry poses... the object of European mean's bugged-out eyes. Or European women are imagined in a hareem, painted in ethnic garb for flavor.
